# recipes-app

Simple React app to show, edit and search for recipes. Redux state stored on a
node app, accessed via express.

### TODO
* Mock recipes file
* Serve store eagerly, maybe use localstorage
* Each display item should contain a "content editable"

  * Text area
  * Each collection item should contain one
